    <!--<p style="color: red;background-color: blue;">Everytime I realize theres something wrong when I see you
        The way you try to prophesize that dreams just can't come true
        Those times you try to undermind my reach for what I still believe
        The times you try to bring me down, cut me up, and watch me bleed</p>
    <p>(I know.)

        But now the hand of fate has turned, opened up and turned inside
        What you stole, dreams returned. My belief in life
        
        (I know.)
        
        When you turn, you, you turn aside
        When you burn, you, you burn alive
        
        Cause everytime I opened up, well, you were never 'round
        And everytime I lost myself, you were nowhere to be found
        I lived inside an innocence, but innocence was born to die
        Inside the soul of everyone who's lost their faith in life
        
        Life is a dream to me
        Life is a dream to me</p>
